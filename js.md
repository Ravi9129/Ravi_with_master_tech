üîπ High-paying jobs (15L-40L+) ke interviews mein interviewer yahi check karte hain:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Kya tum JS ke core concepts deeply samajhte ho?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Kya tum complex scenarios handle kar paoge production mein?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Kya tumhara sochne ka tareeka scalable, maintainable aur secure solutions banane ka hai?
4Ô∏è‚É£ Kya tum async patterns, performance tuning, aur modern tooling (Webpack/Babel/ES6+) ko real projects mein apply kar chuke ho?

üí° In questions ko padhne ke baad kya karna chahiye?

Har question ko explain karne ki practice karo jaise tum kisi ko padha rahe ho ‚Äî this improves your articulation.

Har important topic ka code likho aur run karo ‚Äî e.g., debounce, throttle, Promise patterns.

Projects mein jo kiya hai, unse real examples jodo ‚Äî 
jaise ‚ÄúHumne ek dashboard mein 1000 rows ke liye event delegation kiya tha performance improve karne ke liye.‚Äù

üö® Caution: Interviews mein sif theory nahi, interviewer real projects ka experience bhi poochte hain. Tumhare projects mein:

JS optimizations kaise kiya?

Memory leaks kab aaye aur kaise fix kiya?

API error handling aur retries kaise likhe?

Ye sab share karne ki ability honi chahiye.
