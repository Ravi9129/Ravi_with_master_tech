‚úÖ Tips for Real-World Interviews:
Always explain why you chose a particular solution.

Back your answers with examples of actual challenges you faced on projects.

Discuss trade-offs: performance vs. maintainability, simplicity vs. flexibility.

Mention modern practices: MAUI Handlers, Shell navigation, Blazor Hybrid, .NET 9 updates.
