üî¥ Lekin kuch aur bhi zaruri cheezein hain jo interview ke alawa tumhe differentiate karengi aur high-paying job dilayengi:
1Ô∏è‚É£ System design knowledge ‚Äì jaise scalable architecture for Next.js apps with CDN, caching, load balancing, micro-frontends.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Soft skills & problem solving ‚Äì communication, explaining architecture, debugging approach.
3Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript & React deep knowledge ‚Äì because Next.js is React-based, toh React fundamentals strong hone chahiye.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Backend basics ‚Äì agar tum API routes likh rahe ho, toh security, rate limiting, authentication concepts important hain.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing ‚Äì Cypress, Jest ya Playwright se Next.js apps ka testing setup kaise karte ho.
6Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD ‚Äì GitHub Actions, Vercel integrations ya AWS pipeline knowledge.
